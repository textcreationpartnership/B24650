            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Interest of the <hi>Nation,</hi> the <hi>Sugar Plantations,</hi> and the <hi>Refiners</hi> of <hi>Sugars,</hi> stated.</head>
            <p>IT is observable how industriously busie some have been in misrepresenting the <hi>true Interests</hi> of the <hi>Plantations,</hi> when 'tis so frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that a Relief to the <hi>Refiners</hi> by a Draw-back will be injurious to the said <hi>Plantations:</hi> To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate such Impositions, wherever they have obtained; it will be necessary here to shew, that the Relief the <hi>Refiners</hi> do crave is of as great Use and Advantage to <hi>them,</hi> as to the <hi>Refiners.</hi> And although a Petition now in the House of Commons, from those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in all the <hi>Sugar-Plantations,</hi> and which import <hi>Brown Sugars</hi> only, being the first Product, asserting the same, puts it out of all doubt; yet it will not be amiss to shew wherefore it is so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Refining</hi> of Sugars in <hi>England</hi> is now brought to so low an ebb, that the Question is, Shall it be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or continued? If destroyed, where will the <hi>Brown</hi> or <hi>Muscovado</hi> Importers sell their Sugars? <hi>Jamaica, Nevis, Antegoa, Monserrat,</hi> S. <hi>Christopher,</hi> and at least four parts of five in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> are all such. If take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206620:3"/> away a Draw-back, they have for exporting to Foreigners, be such a Hardship upon them, being by that confined, as they say, to <hi>England</hi> only for a Market; will their being destitute of a Market at all in <hi>England,</hi> and forced to seek and depend upon a foreign Market alone, help them? But the <hi>Refiner</hi> desires only to be enabled to make this a better, and so a Market of choice for them, and leave them their Draw-back and a Liberty thereby to take any other, when this pleases them not. Can they contrive better for themselves than to multiply Buyers? And that there should be contending between <hi>England</hi> and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Markets who shall give most for their <hi>Sugars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By many Arguments, more than is needful here to use, it's evident there's an union of Interests, and inseparable, without prejudicing both, the one as a Seller, the other as a Buyer; they draw one Breath, live and dye together. How comes it then that many whom it concerns to be truly informed are thus abused?</p>
            <p>To discover this, it may be observed, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interest not amounting in number to a fourth part of but one Island, <hi>viz. Barbadoes,</hi> that clay their <hi>Sugars.</hi> The Heads of this Interest, though small in Number, are great in Figure, and imployed where they are most capable to manage a little and private Interest to great Advantages. They assume the Care of the Welfare of all the <hi>Plantations;</hi> but it's plain that the few of their own is only aimed at, and that to the Ruine of all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:206620:3"/> rest; for they, by brining in their <hi>White Sugars</hi> and <hi>Molosses,</hi> lower and sink a Market for the <hi>Muscovado</hi>-Importer, even to a greater degree of a Burthen than the Duties that are imposed upon them amount to.</p>
            <p>We do not render the Duty as little on them; those concerned for the Interests of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Plantations,</hi> may happen to see occasion to make this less, and that on the clay'd Importer more, or otherwise to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage an Interest that's so diametrically opposite to both. To the first enough hath been said; the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nation in its darling Jewel, the Navigation, is as much impaired already as this Interest hath gained footing, and the Growth and Increase of it will as much impair and ruine the Navigation, as the Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the use of two thirds of our Shipping that's used by the <hi>Muscovado</hi>-Importer amounts to; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the stated Rule in proportioning of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on Sugar, and which is the exactest Computation possibly to be made. Three Hundred of <hi>Muscovado</hi> or <hi>Brown</hi> makes One Hundred of <hi>White.</hi> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Subsidy Duty is 5 <hi>s.</hi> on <hi>White,</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> on <hi>Brown:</hi> The Impost Duty 7 <hi>s.</hi> on <hi>White,</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> on <hi>Brown;</hi> so it's Three for One at least; and consequently one Ship of <hi>White</hi> brings the Lading of three of <hi>Brown:</hi> And is this the way to maintain Nurseries for our Seamen? Have we any that may be properly called so, besides the <hi>Plantations</hi> and <hi>Newcastle?</hi> For that of <hi>Newfound-Land</hi> is lost, but how is not our business
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206620:4"/> to treat of here; lamented it is, but prevented would have been better.</p>
            <p>If the Maxim of Production abroad and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture at home that the most Politick Governments ever kept close to be not enjoyn'd here, possibly we may have half a Score Weavers go to the <hi>Plantations</hi> and buy Negroes, and weave the Cotton-Wool up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Place, the Tobacco Strippers and Cutters go to <hi>Virginia</hi> and follow their Functions there, and so lessen the (occasion of Shipping and) Custom; and how far the Evils that attend Presidents in this nature may grow, who knows? Many Thousands of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies have now a Livelihood and Dependance on <hi>Refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Sugars,</hi> and those Manufactures, that through these Mischiefs must perish. Its an ordinary Charge when Sugar-Houses in full work to expend one House with another 1000 <hi>l.</hi> which is 50000 <hi>l. per an.</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom; few Trades but either depend on, or are benefited by them.</p>
            <p>By all which it's seen the <hi>Nation</hi>'s, <hi>Plantation</hi>'s, and <hi>Refiner</hi>'s Interest is one and entire, all Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges circulating evenly through them; and that of the <hi>Clayers,</hi> a Worm at the Root preying upon all Three: And shall all these Interests be sacrificed to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of a few already over-grown rich Men? For what concerns the Revenue in the <hi>Refiners</hi> Draw-back upon <hi>Sugars,</hi> its a perfect plain Bargain of 20 <hi>per cent.</hi> profit to the King; the King gives the <hi>Refiner</hi> 7 <hi>s.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:206620:4"/> to save himself 9 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> Three Hundred of <hi>Brown Sugar</hi> exported, draws back 9 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> The <hi>Refiner</hi> working this, produces but One Hundred of <hi>White,</hi> for which desires but 7 <hi>s.</hi> when exported; it's plainly a Hiring the <hi>Refiner</hi> to keep the <hi>Muscovado-Sugars</hi> from being exported: And for every 9 <hi>s.</hi> 3. he saved the Revenue, the King will give him 7 <hi>s.</hi> The <hi>Claying-Plantations</hi> draw back 9 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> and no Words made on't; how they come to be priviledged thus is matter for Amazement, when the <hi>English</hi> refined <hi>Sugars</hi> are imprison'd in <hi>England,</hi> nor daring to book abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Hundred. And had they but this Market to themselves, it would be a Favour; but if good at any time, the <hi>Clayer</hi> reaps the Benefit of it, until he makes it bad with his Quantities, and then picks his Markets abroad, having 9 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> Draw-back as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>It's evident from what hath been said, that the Interest of the <hi>Nation</hi> in all its parts, the <hi>Plantations</hi> in general and the <hi>Refiners,</hi> is interwoven and one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; and that the small Interest of <hi>Claying</hi> of <hi>Sugars</hi> in but a small part, as yet, of but one <hi>Sugar-Island, viz. Barbadoes,</hi> is destructive to all; and the Benefits that arise from it are so far from being publick, that it only makes a few Men very rich, and all the other Planters very poor; like a Wen that grows out of this Political Body or Interest, that draws all the Nutriment to it self, to the languishing of the whole Body.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:206620:5"/>
            <p>It's a common Cry, the <hi>Plantations</hi> lie under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Burthens and Pressures; and 'tis too true, that in the general they do; and it's hoped this may serve for a Glass in which it may be seen, and from whence it chiefly proceeds; and if the Farmers in <hi>England</hi> have never so good Crops and yet have bad Markets, they cannot be rich. Needs must the Importers of <hi>Brown Sugar</hi> therefore be poor when their Markets are bad, as already is shewed, by the Quantities of clay'd Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and <hi>Molosses.</hi> Sir <hi>John Bawden</hi> in his life time was wont frequently to say, they had better bury their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losses</hi> in the <hi>Plantations</hi> or cast them into the Sea, than send them hither; for <hi>Molosses</hi> always sunk the Price of Sugar to a great degree; and he was known to be a Person that understood the Interest of the <hi>Plantations,</hi> and as much interested therein as most in his time.</p>
            <p>It's pity, since <hi>Refining</hi> in <hi>England</hi> hath been a Trade before ever we had <hi>Plantations,</hi> it should be lost by the having them, when the having <hi>Plantations</hi> of our own is so natural a means to make it flourish, and others that have none of their own do flourish by the Product of ours. But so it is, that the <hi>English Refiners</hi> have not been able for many Months to work at all, altho at great Charges with standing still, many Houses held by long Leases, some 140 <hi>l.</hi> some 150 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> Stocks Lying in Utensils cost 1000 <hi>l.</hi> or 1200 <hi>l.</hi> and these when a House is demolished not worth a third part of the Mony. Their Estates are much impair'd already, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:206620:5"/> without Relief many must be ruin'd; and although <hi>Subjects</hi> in, and in a sense may be said to be <hi>Children</hi> of, the Kingdom; have their Bread given to <hi>Strangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this introduces a few Words, with respect to them, <hi>viz. Holland, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Hamborough,</hi> to which places our <hi>Brown Sugars</hi> are conveyed to be Refined; which being the Products of our own <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> as <hi>Wooll</hi> is our own Nation, might be wrought all of it at home, to the great Advantage of the Kingdom and Revenue. And it's observable that formerly before we were so kind as to send them our <hi>Brown Sugars,</hi> at least in such Quantities as now we do, they used to buy our <hi>Molosses; Holland</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> being the chief Markets for that Commodity; But now they have gotten our Meat, they will have none of our Porrage, and at any time when <hi>Molosses</hi> is low here, they lay a high Duty to keep it out from coming there; great Quantities of <hi>Loafe-Sugar</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was used to be exported to <hi>Flanders,</hi> but when they found means to have our <hi>Brown Sugar</hi> there was a Duty of 2 <hi>d. per</hi> pound laid upon it, and so kept our; so that what little Care soever hath been used to preserve this Trade in <hi>England,</hi> these Instances shew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard others have for it; and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> cannot but be reckoned good Judges in the Interest of Trade: And well may they esteem it, for by it they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased their Trade and Navigation, although with the abatement of as much of ours; great Quantities
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:206620:6"/> of <hi>Loafe-Sugar</hi> were formerly exported for all the <hi>East</hi> Country, <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Turky,</hi> Places which now the <hi>Hollanders</hi> serve; the Train of Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that attend this is too long to recite. Returns in Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for our naval Stores are Commodities our Nation cannot be without, and by this means the <hi>Dutch</hi> have them to better Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages than we.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hamborough</hi> likewise, that hath not one <hi>Plantation</hi> of its own, makes so good and Improvement of the Talent of <hi>Refining</hi> of Sugar cast into its Lap, that tho but one City or Town it hath near as many Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Houses as all <hi>England</hi> hath, for all its being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged with so many <hi>Plantations</hi> of its own.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole the <hi>Refiners</hi> Case cannot but be seen to be very hard, and to give them such a Relief as they pray for, cannot be thought to be too much, since it will when received (although preserve them from ruin, which is a great Mercy) never enrich them; they ask but 7 <hi>s.</hi> because the Revenue may gain 2 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> by giving it; the <hi>Sugar-Clayer,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is said, hath 9 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> and the reason the <hi>Refiners</hi> desire not as much as they have, is not because they deserve it not as much, nor because they need it not much more.</p>
            <p>And they humbly hope the Honorable the House of Commons, now their Case being known, will take notice in what Interest they stand, and provide
